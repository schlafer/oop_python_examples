# Connecting to email server...

# Sending email...
# Disconnecting from email server...

# Oh no, I don't have such a simple API to just send an email (this thing I actually want to do). Much easier to make mistakes -- I might forget to disconnect after sending.
# What happens if implementation details change? Client code has to change.
